# Utility Hub 🔧  
A collection of web applications built to experiment, learn, and strengthen full-stack development skills. This repository serves as a **utility hub**, where I’ll create and organize projects using technologies like **Next.js**, **MongoDB & Mongoose**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

## 🚀 Features  
Developing useful and reusable tools while practicing scalable architecture, database integration, modern UI design, and development best practices.

## 📁 Structure  
Each subfolder in the repository represents an independent app, organized with a modular and maintainable approach. The backend is built using **Next.js API routes** or **Express**, and the frontend with **React + Tailwind CSS**.

## 📦 Current Projects  
- **todo-api**: A basic task API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB  
- **weather-app**: Displays weather information for a user-input city. Includes two versions: one using Gemini and another with a public API.

*(More apps coming soon with Next.js and React)*
